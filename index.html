                                in Wales, this hostel has a rich history tied to mountaineering and the great outdoors.
                                Originally built as a coach inn in the late 1800s, it served travelers journeying through
                                the rugged terrain of Snowdonia.
                                What makes Pen-y-Pass special is its role in outdoor culture. Over the decades, it became a
                                base for legendary climbers who tackled the Snowdon Horseshoe—a challenging circuit of
                                ridges—and contributed to the development of modern mountaineering in the UK.</p>

                                furnishings, makes it a unique blend of history and hospitality.</p>

                                elements of his famous novel Oliver Twist. In the 20th century, it served as a magistrates'
                                court and famously hosted trials for punk bands like The Clash. Today, the hostel preserves
